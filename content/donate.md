TJI is raising funds to hire a Data Director who will manage  our growing collection of unbiased criminal data sets and reports. The more clean, current, and accessible data we can make available to the public, the more data-based decisions our elected officials, advocates, and policy-makers can make.

As a non-profit organization, TJI is  entirely funded through public support and we hope you will join us “Seize the Data” by making your tax-deductible donation today.
