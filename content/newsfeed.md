    description: 'By: Eva Ruth Moravec, executive director of the Texas Justice
    Initiative... For most of my 15 years as a reporter, the way I use words
    has been my focus. I’ve challenged myself to use them as efficiently as
    possible, spent hours deciding which ones to submit to an editor, and
    fumbled in identifying the right ones in definitions. When I started
    collecting data on officer-involved shootings in Texas, I did so as a way to
    find the stories, the narratives woven delicately with words that could help
    people resonate with complex concepts like the reasonableness of an officer’s use of force.'
