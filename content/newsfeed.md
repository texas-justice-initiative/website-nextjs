    description: In Texas, state agencies generally expire every 12 years unless the
      Texas Legislature renews them in legislation. Before their expiration date
      (called "Sunset"), agencies are put under the microscope by the Sunset
      Advisory Commission, which reports to legislators. In November, the
      Commission published its evaluation
      ([report](https://www.sunset.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/reports/Texas%20Commission%20on%20Jail%20Standards%20Staff%20Report_11-6-20.pdf),
