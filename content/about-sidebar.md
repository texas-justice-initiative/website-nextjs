### Our Mission

Collect and maintain data on criminal justice in Texas that can serve as a free resource for reporters, researchers, policymakers, activists and the general public.Â 

### Our Vision

To give Texans the most dependable data and most complete picture of law enforcement in the state, enabling better understanding.

### Our Values

We gather data from state and local governmental entities, pointing out errors and missing reports as we go along, in order to create a more complete and accurate account. 

We seek to improve understanding through presenting information in a rich context and combining a variety of data.

We encourage Texas to continue to be a leader in the country in requiring transparency in many aspects of criminal justice and law enforcement. 

We wish to give Texans of all creed more information on how criminal justice in Texas operates.
