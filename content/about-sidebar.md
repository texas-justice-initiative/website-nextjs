### Our Mission

Collect and maintain data on criminal justice in Texas that can serve as a free resource for reporters, researchers, policymakers, activists and the general public. 

### Our Vision

To give Texans the most dependable data and most complete picture of law enforcement in the state, enabling better understanding.

### Our Values

We gather data from state and local governmental entities, pointing out errors and missing reports as we go along, in order to create a more complete and accurate account. 

We seek to improve understanding through presenting information in a rich context and combining a variety of data.

We encourage Texas to continue to be a leader in the country in requiring law enforcement to be more transparent. 

We wish to give Texans of all creed more information on how law enforcement agencies and officers operate.
