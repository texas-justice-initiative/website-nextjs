title: COVID-19 fatalities in Texas law enforcement
---
Much of the country began to self-quarantine in early 2020, staying home from school and work. But for law enforcement officers, going to work was not optional, and meant risking getting [infected with COVID-19](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/783fae2f8c0c4759a3ae1ccb7ef51668/page/page_0/). As of early September, more than 100 officers nationwide had died after contracting the coronavirus, “more than gun violence, car accidents and all other causes combined,” the *Washington Post* [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/02/coronavirus-deaths-police-officers-2020/).
