Intention in these instances is an unequivocal desire to die;

      * Death: caused by an illness or internal malfunction of the body, by homicide, by accident or misadventure, or by an undetermined cause;

      * Serious bodily injury: a bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death or that causes death, serious permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ;

      * Escape: individual escaped from inside of a secure perimeter;

      * sexual assault: the penetration of the anus, sexual organ, or mouth of another person by any means, without that person's consent; and

Texas state law requires jails to report certain information about the people who are in their custody to the Texas Commission on Jail Standards (TCJS), which oversees the facilities. TCJS then compiles these data in monthly reports and [posts](https://www.tcjs.state.tx.us/population-reports/) them online. 

TJI is building a tool to make it easier to analyze four types of these reports over time, with unique visualizations and filtering capabilities. Our first step was to accumulate all of the available reports, which we are sharing here. Some of the reports found below are available on TCJS’ “Historic Populations Reports” [page](https://www.tcjs.state.tx.us/historical-population-reports/); many others — including all of the “Serious Incident Reports” — are not.  

TJI cannot vouch for the accuracy of the data in these TCJS reports. We also acknowledge that some reports are missing — including reports from the second half of 2022 — and are in the process of making our collection fully complete. 

The monthly reports below fall into the following categories:
