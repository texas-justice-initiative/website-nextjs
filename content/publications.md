## Officer-Involved Shootings and Custodial Deaths in Texas (2018)

By Everett Wetchler

From 2005 to 20018, there were 8,730 deaths of civilians in the custody of Texas law enforcement. In the past decade, officer-involved shootings in Texas have been on the rise. Data obtained from the Texas Office of the Attorney General shows that since Sept. 1, 2015, there have been 466 civilians shot by Texas law enforcement, and 78 officers have been shot.

Officers involved in shootings skew younger and male than the general population of Texas law enforcement officers. Overall, most deaths that occur in Texas law enforcement custody are due to natural causes, but that nearly half of all deaths of inmates housed alone in a jail cell are suicides.

## Texas Custodial Death Report (2016)

By Amanda Woog

From 2005 to 2015, a reported 6,913 people died in the custody of law enforcement and other state officials in Texas. More than 1,900 of the people who died (28%) had not been convicted of, or in many cases, even charged with a crime. Despite recent growing interest in counting and reporting on custodial and police-involved deaths, most of the nearly 7,000 people who died have never had their stories told, and aggregate data regarding the manner and locations of their deaths have not been widely available.
