<!-- 
  We're including this static form so that Netlify's bots will parse it and
  accept POST requests for the download-survey form. When we add new fields to
  the dynamic download-survey form, we'll need to add corresponding fields to
  this static version.

  From https://community.netlify.com/t/common-issue-form-problems-form-debugging-404-when-submitting/92:
    > If you’re using a pure-javascript form instead, this additional step is required:
      > You still need to include an HTML form that meets the criteria above, including
      > all the inputs with the same names as the javascript form. This is required
      > because we parse HTML to find forms during your deploy - but we don’t try to
      > parse javascript files. This means if you are using React, Vue, etc. which
      > create HTML elements using Javascript during the render, you’ll still need to
      > include an actual HTML file that includes all of the form details in it,
      > including all possible inputs that you want to use.
