        Increasing transparency in the criminal justice system is of vital importance to us at the Texas Justice
        Initiative. Our work relies on the use of information that can be released to the public.

      <p>
        Currently on our website, <strong>we compile data about three main incident types that occur in Texas</strong>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Injury of officer(s) and/or civilian(s): </strong>Any shooting of or by a Texas peace officer,
          occurring while the officer is on- or off-duty, causing an injury.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Death of officer(s) and/or civilian(s): </strong> Any fatal shooting of or by a Texas peace officer,
          occurring while the officer is on- or off-duty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Death in custody: </strong>
          Any death of an individual while they are in a penal institution, in the custody of a peace officer or as a
          result of a peace officer’s use of force, in a jail, correctional facility, or state juvenile facility dies.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        After an incident, the governmental agency in which it occurred (i.e. a county jail etc.) is required to file a
        report for the respective incident (

      <p>
        The Texas OAG publishes the raw .PDFs of these reports. Through open records requests filed monthly, TJI obtains
        data from the reports through the Texas OAG.
      </p>
      <p>
        We then clean, analyze, and present the data to the public – both in the form of a full data set and in
        comparative graphics – through our analysis pipeline.

        Our analysis pipeline is summarized below. The scripts we use in the analysis pipeline can be found on{' '}

        TJI is currently acquiring and analyzing more data sets, and we’re always on the lookout for more. Stay tuned as
        we release more reports and complete data sets in the future, and please email info@texasjusticeinitiative.org
        if you know of a data set we should include.
