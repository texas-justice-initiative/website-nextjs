              As the novel coronavirus began to spread in early 2020, it was quickly determined that the disease that it

              The Texas Justice Initiative is tracking deaths of individuals related to COVID-19 in local, state and
              federal jails in prisons, displayed on the map below. Click on a cluster to zoom in on areas with multiple
              fatalities. Users can also click on the clusters to see details about the facilities and incidents.
              Additionally, use the filters below the map to view fatalities by age or facility type. For state prisons,
              compare the pattern of deaths in the filtered TJI map to the location of TDCJ facilities,{' '}
