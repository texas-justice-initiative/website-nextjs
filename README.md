## Javascript Style Guide

To maintain consistency in code formatting and to avoid a ton of problems with Github tracking changes that are just differences in tab width, etc., this repo is set up according to [Wes Bos's No-Sweatâ„¢ Eslint and Prettier Setup](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos)

The [Local/Per Project Install](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos) is taken care of when you run `yarn` or `npm install`. Please follow the [With VS Code](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos) instructions (if you're using VS Code) to have the formatting applied on save.

## Proptype Validation

We are using [prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) for component property validation. When building or updating components that have property, validation should now be incorporated as well.

See the [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) for more information.

## Using Next JS

To create a new page, simply create a new js file in [/pages](./pages). You can use this [template](./pages/_template-page.js) as a starter or create your own React Stateless or Class Component.

There is also an [example page](./pages/example-page.js) that has some examples of using Styled Components and where we can add other heavily commented examples in the future.
